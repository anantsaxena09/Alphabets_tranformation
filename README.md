Many stylized fonts are available in the English Alphabet. 
The font consists of straight lines and curves. Each letter of the alphabet is a collection of straight lines and arcs (mostly semicircles) joined together. 
-Divided the Alphabet into lines and semicircles, then
-Formed a parametric equation of each line and curve to pass them into transformation functions to get the transformed font.
